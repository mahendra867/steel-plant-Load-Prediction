    cmd: python src\PROJECTML\pipeline\stage_01_data_ingestion.py  # here we need to mention the main file of the data_ingestion pipeline so here main file means the file which triggers whole data_ingestion pipeline this file code of data_ingestion pipeline we need to mention in our case it is in pipeline folder which is stage_01_data_ingestion.py  file in which is in pipeline file it contains the main  code for triggering whole data_ingestion source code which is  this cmd key helps us to execeute that main component code of data_ingestion pipeline
    deps:   # here in order to execute the main component of the data_ingestion pipleine for executing the above command in order to trigger whole data_ingestion sorce code component it that above file stage_01_data_ingestion.py file requires some dependencies which we mention in this key and which are
      - src\PROJECTML\pipeline\stage_01_data_ingestion.py  # so above cmd itself dependes on this relative in order to execute the above data_ingestion pipeline
      - config\config.yaml # in order to execute the stage_01_data_ingestion.py it depends on this config file thats y i mention here
    outs: # here we need to mention output file of the above data_ingestion pipeline execution  and this output is acts as input in order to execute  the next pipeline  which is stage_02_data_transformation.py pipeline
